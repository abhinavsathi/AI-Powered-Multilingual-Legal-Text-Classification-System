# AI-Powered Multilingual Legal Text Classification System

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a multilingual legal text classification system using a fine-tuned **XLM-RoBERTa transformer model**. The system processes informal patrol notes and classifies them into structured legal offense categories.

The project combines transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) with rule-based entity extraction to convert unstructured text into structured legal outputs.
